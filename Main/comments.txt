* Decreased the code required to create the voronoi Regions
    (hopefully error has been minimized)

* A test.py file was created
    - Create a panda dataframe that will store the information 
      collected from the runs

Bugs Note:
* Drone Path Algorithm is duplicating paths.
* Sometimes, optimal charging stations are not found, 
  even when solution was found on other runs
* Sometimes, a tour is not found,
  even when tour was found on other runs

* There is no validation for when the drone is returning back to the CS
  Some type of validation is needed, otherwise, the prime vertices will go out of the
  original triangle.

* The validation used in the code does not work for all cases, and the prime vertices are leaving the triangle.
* There's alot of repeated code in the algorithm and makes it hard to find a solution. Considering rewriting the algorithm to increase readiability
    and find a solution to solve the special cases.
