* Decreased the code required to create the voronoi Regions
    (hopefully error has been minimized)

* A test.py file was created
    - Create a panda dataframe that will store the information 
      collected from the runs

Bugs Note:
* Drone Path Algorithm is duplicating paths.
* Sometimes, optimal charging stations are not found, 
  even when solution was found on other runs
* Sometimes, a tour is not found,
  even when tour was found on other runs
